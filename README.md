This project is a RESTful API for storing and retrieving multimedia game assets including sprites (images), audio files, and player scores using FastAPI and MongoDB Atlas.

Development Environment Setup
This project uses Python with the following dependencies:

FastAPI – For modern and fast web framework for building APIs

Uvicorn – ASGI server for running FastAPI applications

Motor – So we have an asynchronous MongoDB driver

Pydantic – So that data validation and settings management is handled

python-dotenv – For managing the environment variables

python-multipart – For handling file uploads

pymongo – For MongoDB access

Setup Instructions
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the project root with your MongoDB connection string:

bash
Copy
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
Run the API locally:

bash
Copy
uvicorn main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the interactive API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
